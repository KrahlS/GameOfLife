Independent Java Project: building Conway's Game Of Life in the console

## What is this about? ##  
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where the end result of the simulation is entirely determined by the intial state of the game. In a sense, it is not really a *game* after all- it is more of a **simulation**. 

Conway's Game Of Life is built upon a grid of square cells, each of which is either **alive** or **dead**. Each cell interacts with each of its adjacent neighbors to determine its next state. This transition is determined by 4 rules: 

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
